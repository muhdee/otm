# OTM
**Open-source termux malware!**

This malware targets image files inside internal storage and destroys the terminal. After a complete run, all the image files inside the root directory as well as branches of that directory will turn red. The damage is irrecoverable as the program re-writes the existing files. Cross compile and statically link the source code specifically for your target machine.
This piece of code is highly malicious and can cause serious data damage. Do not run unless you are completely aware what the consequences could be.
